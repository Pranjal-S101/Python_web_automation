# Python_web_automation
This repository contains an automated Trello Bot implemented in Python using Selenium. The script logs into your Trello account, navigates to a specific board, creates a task card in a list, and captures a screenshot for confirmation. This is useful for automating repetitive tasks and verifying board states.
